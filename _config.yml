    bio: Aramboa is the alias of Vienna-based producer Moritz Ren√© Scharf. Being involved in music since his early childhood coming from a jazz background on guitar, he started producing and performing electronic music quickly. After a first release experimenting on the edge of electronica/downtempo, shaped by lively collaborations, especially with singer Elena Shirin, international festival appearances in Europe, the U.S. and South-Africa followed. Now he is off for presenting his latest studio-works where dreamy/artificial soundscapes and a catchy live brass-section collide into a beatdriven euphoric dancefloor experience.
